# XGBoost Stack

This image creates a stack for use with nvidia-docker that builds on the 
CUDA stack and adds Intel's Python 3 distribution as well as numpy, pandas, 
joblib, and scikit-learn in order to have a robust base for running XGBoost 
efficiently with both MKL optimized math operations and the ability to use a 
GPU for running XGBoost itself.

## Using this image
In order for this image to work properly, you must use nvidia-docker instead 
of just using docker.

When using this as a base image, the default entrypoint is an executable 
located at `/app/sh/entrypoint.sh`.
